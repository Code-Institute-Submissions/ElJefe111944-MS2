*   The website has an entire page dedicated to helping the user with their decision on the type of Sofa that suits them. The page contains six pictures with information below and a button with the option of adding the corresponding sofa to a shopping cart. This page is where the user selects the sofa of their choice by adding the sofa to the shopping cart and completing the purchase.

All the user has to do is to click on the links displayed in the navigation dropdown to browse the page of interest on the website.

The image modal provides a full screen view of the sofa of interest as well as information for the user to read.

Here the user can access the sofa designers Sonnenaufgang’s other social media accounts just by clicking on the different icons available. Furthermore, there are links provided at the left-hand side of the footer to all the other pages of the site instead of making the user scroll up to the top of the page.

__Interesting bugs or problems__

No major bugs or problems were encountered during the making of this project. Any issues that were encountered were only minor ones such as the mistyping of code and white spaces between elements.

All the minor issues which did occur could have been avoid but due to my lack of experience and this being my second individual project I was unsure on the best practices. This led me to adopt more of a trial and error approach to creating the website. 


## __Deployment__

The project was developed with the use of Gitpod’s Intergraded Development Environment. All developments and changes made to the project were saved and pushed to an external repository stated below using GitHub. This eliminates the risk of deleting a key component of the project by accident as all steps can be reversed thus undoing any unwanted changes made. 

Deploying the project to the hosting platform GitHub:
1.  Go to the repository created from my GitHub account called below:
https://github.com/ElJefe111944/MS2.

2.  Click on the settings tab located in the menu at the top of the page.

3.  Scroll down the page to the GitHub Pages section.

4.  Change the source to Master branch which will refresh the page.

5.  Further down in the GitHub pages section a green box will appear confirming the website has been deployed.

6.  Click on the link in the green box (also displayed below) to go to the live website.
